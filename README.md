## What is Rivet?

Rivet is a developer Wallet & DevTools for Anvil (akin to [Browser DevTools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#how_to_open_the_devtools_in_your_browser) or [React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools)). It is a browser extension that enables developers to inspect, debug, modify, and manipulate the state of Ethereum: accounts, blocks, contracts & the node itself. Rivet is also compatible with any production dApp, meaning you can simulate any type of action from either an Account attached on the Anvil instance, or by "impersonating" another Account on the network.

By integrating [EIP-6963: Multi Injected Provider Discovery](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963), Rivet is designed to be used alongside and with other consumer browser wallets like MetaMask or Rainbow to provide more engrained developer tooling and workflows for Ethereum.

Rivet is currently a **work-in-progress prototype**, and aimed to be **contributor first & friendly**. If you would like to contribute, check out the [Contributing Guide](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [good first issues](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/rivet/labels/good%20first%20issue).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repo to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/rivet.git
```

### 2. Install Node.js and pnpm

You need to install **Node.js v18 or higher** and **pnpm v8 or higher**.

You can run the following commands in your terminal to check your local Node.js and pnpm versions:

```bash
node -v
pnpm -v
```

If the versions are not correct or you don't have Node.js or pnpm installed, download and follow their setup instructions:

- Install Node.js using [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or from the [official website](https://nodejs.org)
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### 3. Install dependencies

Once in the project's root directory, run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Run the dev server

After you have installed dependencies, you are ready to run the dev server for the Extension. To do so, run the following:

```bash
pnpm dev 
```

This will run a script that will build the Web Extension and start a dev server for the Test Dapp, it will also open the Test Dapp in a new browser tab.

### 5. Installing the Web Extension

Once you have your dev server running, you can install the Web Extension in your browser. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser's Extensions page
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked" in the top left corner
4. Select the `dist/dev` folder in Rivet's root directory
5. You're good to go! Don't forget to pin the Extension to your browser's toolbar for easy access. ðŸŽ‰
